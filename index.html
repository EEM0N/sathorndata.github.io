		Sathorn Model is a project that has attempted to find a sustainable 
		solution for traffic congestion problems in the Sathorn'area, Bangkok. 
		The activities are managed by the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn 
		University. Sathorn Road serves as the gateway linking the residential 
		area on the western side of the Chao Phraya River and the river-eastern 
		sideâ€™s business area. The number of 150,000 vehicles drive every
		weekday on Sathorn Road. The Sathorn-Surasak intersection has both 
		inbound and outbound traffic flow. There are a total of three types 
		of sensors installed on the approaching lanes of the Sathorn-Surasak 
		intersection in the Sathorn area: CCTV cameras, thermal cameras and 
		induction loop coil sensors. The dataset has 
		temporal and spatial coverage of Sathorn road's main urban areas, 
		including weekdays, weekends, and public and national holidays.
